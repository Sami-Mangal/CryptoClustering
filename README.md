# Crypto Clustering Starter Code

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to perform clustering on cryptocurrency data. The main objective is to explore different clustering techniques and evaluate their performance on various features derived from cryptocurrency market data.

# Overview

The notebook is structured to guide you through the following key steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
    * Load cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file.
    * Perform data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalizing the data.
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:
     * Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
     * Visualize the explained variance to determine the number of principal components to retain.
3. Clustering:
     * Implement different clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
     * Visualize the clusters in the reduced PCA space.
4. Cluster Evaluation:
     * Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as the silhouette score.
     * Analyze the features contributing the most to the principal components and their influence on the clustering outcome.

# Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* seaborn

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```python

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn

```
Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```python
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/crypto-clustering.git
cd crypto-clustering
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```python
jupyter notebook Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb

```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform clustering on the cryptocurrency data.

# Data

The notebook expects the cryptocurrency market data in a CSV format. Ensure the data is structured appropriately before running the analysis.
